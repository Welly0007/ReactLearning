# Travel List - React Tutorial Project

A travel packing list application built as part of [The Ultimate React Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/) on Udemy.

## About This Project

This is a tutorial project focused on learning React state management and form handling. The application helps users create and manage a packing list for their travels, with features to add items, mark them as packed, and track packing progress.

## What I Learned

- **Advanced State Management**: Working with arrays and objects in state
- **Forms in React**: Handling form submissions and controlled components
- **Array Methods**: Using `map()`, `filter()`, and `find()` for state updates
- **Conditional Rendering**: Displaying different content based on state
- **Event Handling**: Managing user interactions (add, delete, toggle)
- **Dynamic Arrays**: Creating arrays with `Array.from()` for dropdowns
- **Derived State**: Calculating statistics from existing state
- **Component Communication**: Passing data and functions between components
- **List Rendering**: Efficiently rendering lists with proper keys

## Features

- **Add Items**: Add new items to your packing list with quantity selection
- **Mark as Packed**: Toggle items between packed/unpacked status
- **Delete Items**: Remove items from the list
- **Statistics**: Real-time tracking of packing progress
- **Clear All**: Option to clear the entire list
- **Sort Options**: Sort items by input order, description, or packed status

## Technologies Used

- React 19.1.0
- Create React App
- CSS3
- JavaScript ES6+

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The application will open at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
